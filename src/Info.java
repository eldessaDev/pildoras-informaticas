	 * ```````````````````Definitions```````````````````
	 * ---Variable: A space in the computer's memory where a value is 
	 * 	stored that can change during program execution.
	 * 
	 * ---Static variable: Implies that the objects do not have their own 
	 * copy of the variable, but share it. to use them you must use the 
	 * name of the class. it does not belong to any object.
	 * 
	 * ---Constant: Space in the computer's memory where a value is 
	 * 	stored that cannot change during program execution. add "final"
	 * 
	 * ---POO: translating the nature of real-life objects into programming code
	 * objects have :
	 * 		a status
	 * 		a behavior (what it can do)
	 * 		a properties.
	 * 
	 * ---Class: model where the common characteristics of a group of objects are written.
	 * 
	 * ---Objects: objects that are built from a class. Objects have properties and Behaviors
	 * 		Properties:
	 * 		Color
	 * 		Weight
	 * 		Height
	 * 		Length
	 * 
	 * 		behaviors (what it is able to do)
	 * 		Start
	 * 		Brake
	 * 		Turn
	 * 		Accelerate
	 * 
	 * ---Methods: allow classes to interact with each other
	 * 
	 * ---Static method:
	 * 		Do not act on objects
	 * 		They do not access copy fields (variables, constants declared 
	 * 		in the class), unless these are also static.
	 * 		To call them we use the name of the class point and the name of the method.
	 * 
	 * ---Getters: Provides the value of a property of the objects.
	 * 
	 * ---Setters: Defines the value of a property of the objects.
	 * 
	
	 * 
	 * ---Construction Method
	 * 	is in charge of giving an initial state to our object
	 *  it always has the same name as the class
	 *  
	 * ---Polymorphism: substitution principle. An object of the subclass 
	 *  can be used as long as the program expects an object of the 
	 *  superclass, i.e. an object can behave differently depending on the 
	 *  context. Object variables are polymorphic.
	 *  
	 * ---Interfaces: Interfaces: set of guidelines that classes (methods) must comply with. They only have 
	 * 	abstract methods and constants.
	 *
	 * 
	 * 
	 * ```````````````````Classes```````````````````
	 * ---Math: Contains methods that allow us to perform mathematical calculations.
	 * 		Math.Sqrt
	 * 		Math.pow
	 * 		Math.sin
	 * 		Math.round
	 * 		Math.PI
